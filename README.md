# Go-Blockchain

Go-Blockchain is an advanced blockchain platform built using Go. It is designed to provide a robust, secure, and extensible framework for developing blockchain-based applications. The platform includes comprehensive features such as smart contracts, decentralised identity management (DID), multi-signature transactions, and a gamification system to incentivise user participation.

## Key Features

### 1. **Blockchain Core**
   - **Efficient Data Structure**: Utilizes a Merkle tree for transaction validation and efficient data storage.
   - **Consensus Mechanisms**: Supports multiple consensus algorithms, including Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).
   - **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts mining difficulty based on network conditions.
   - **Optimized Block Size**: Configurable maximum block size for scalability and performance.

### 2. **Smart Contracts**
   - **Custom DSL**: Write and deploy smart contracts using a domain-specific language (DSL).
   - **Contract Execution Engine**: Executes contracts within a virtual machine, supporting functions like `SET`, `ADD`, and `CALL`.
   - **Persistent State Management**: Smart contracts can maintain state across transactions.

### 3. **Decentralized Identity (DID)**
   - **DID Registry**: Register and manage digital identities on the blockchain.
   - **Authentication**: Authenticate users using cryptographic signatures.
   - **Attribute Management**: Store and manage identity attributes securely on the blockchain.

### 4. **Multi-Signature Transactions**
   - **Enhanced Security**: Require multiple signatures for transaction approval, increasing security.
   - **Flexible Configuration**: Specify the number of required signatures and expiration times for transactions.
   - **UTXO Integration**: Validate multi-signature transactions against the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) set.

### 5. **Gamification**
   - **User Engagement**: Reward users with points for participating in the network (e.g., mining, voting, and transactions).
   - **Cooldown Mechanism**: Prevent abuse by enforcing cooldown periods between actions.
   - **Pattern Detection**: Detect and respond to suspicious patterns of activity.

### 6. **Secure Networking**
   - **TLS Encryption**: Ensure secure communication between nodes using TLS (Transport Layer Security).
   - **Peer Discovery**: Automatically discover and connect to other nodes in the network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go:** Make sure you have at least Go 1.23.0 installed. You can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dyst0rti0n/go-blockchain.git
   cd go-blockchain
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   go build -o go-blockchain
   ```

3. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

### Running a Node

1. **Start a Node:**
   ```bash
   ./go-blockchain -node localhost:8080
   ```

2. **Connect to Peers:**
   ```bash
   ./go-blockchain -node localhost:8080 -peers "localhost:8081,localhost:8082"
   ```

### Using the Blockchain

1. **Create a Transaction:**
   ```bash
   Enter choice: 1
   Enter sender: alice
   Enter recipient: bob
   Enter amount: 50
   Enter fee: 1
   ```

2. **Mine a Block:**
   ```bash
   Enter choice: 2
   ```

3. **Deploy a Smart Contract:**
   ```bash
   Enter choice: 4
   Enter smart contract code: SET key value
   ```

4. **Execute a Smart Contract:**
   ```bash
   Enter choice: 5
   Enter smart contract ID: <contract-id>
   Enter method name: CALL
   ```

5. **Print the Blockchain:**
   ```bash
   Enter choice: 3
   ```
