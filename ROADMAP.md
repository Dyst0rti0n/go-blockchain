- [ ] Develop user interface for governance and voting
- [ ] Add more gamification scenarios

### 6. DID (Decentralized Identity) System
- [x] Implement DID registration and management (`did_registry.go`)
- [ ] Add DID authentication and verification processes
- [ ] Integrate DID with smart contracts for identity-based access control

### 7. Cryptography and Security
- [x] Implement cryptographic functions (`crypto.go`)
- [ ] Conduct security audits on cryptographic implementations
- [ ] Add encryption for sensitive data within the blockchain

### 8. Token System
- [x] Develop token management system (`token.go`)
- [ ] Implement token minting and burning processes
- [ ] Integrate token system with smart contracts

### 9. Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for all modules
- [ ] Develop integration tests for multi-module workflows
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for developers
- [ ] Create user guides for deploying and using the blockchain

### 10. Deployment and CI/CD
- [ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) with automated tests
- [ ] Implement continuous deployment (CD) pipelines
- [ ] Provide Docker support for easy deployment

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement sharding for scalability
- [ ] Develop a more sophisticated consensus mechanism (e.g., PoS)
- [ ] Explore cross-chain interoperability
- [ ] Integrate with external data sources (Oracles)
- [ ] Provide support for more advanced cryptographic techniques (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs)
